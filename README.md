# fruits-and-veggies
Week 9 Day 4:
Added seed routes for seeding, clearing, and resetting data
 Created a User schema with a username and password and used bcryptjs to hash that password to be stored in our database
 Used express-sessions to create session for users that are currently logged in
 Used those sessions to check if a user is logged in before displaying any fruits to them
 Attached specific fruits to specific users and only showed the users which fruits they had actually made themselves
